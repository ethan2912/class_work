*EVALUATING NORMAL DISTRIBUTION
 -statistical tests
 -visualization techniques(Right skew, Left skew, Short tails, Long tails)

*SIGNIFICANCE TESTS

*SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION
 -sampling distribution represents the distribution of the point estimates based on samples   of a fixed size from a certain population.
 -standard error tells us how much variation in distribution. 
 - sampling distribution example
	mu_100 = 95.61, mu_rad1_100 = 93.43, mu_rad2_100 = 95.30, mu_rad3_100 =94.60
	mu = 94.52, sigmax = 1.92.
	
	The standard deviation of the sample mean sigmax tells us how far the typical estimate is away from the actualpopulation mean, 1.92 min.

*CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM FOR THE SAMPLE MEAN

	x ~N(mean = mu, SE = sigma /sqrt(n) 
	 
	- SE represents standard error of the mean, which is defined as the standard 	  deviation of the sampling distribution,
	- sigma is the standard deviation of the population, and
	- n is the sample size

 - In Case of SD of population is unknown, use the standard deviation of the 
   sample(s) to approximate the standard error of the mean: 
	
	x ~N(mean = mu, SE = s/sqrt(n)

*FORMULATION OF THE PRACTICAL PROBLEM IN TERMS OF STATISTICAL HYPOTHESE
Null hypothesis (H0)
Alternative Hypothesis (HA)

- basically a standard with which the evidence for HA can be compared.
- H0 is rejected in favour of HA
- Conditions of hypothesis(page 115)
