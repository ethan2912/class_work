*Measure of centrality
 -Mean 
 -Median 
 -Mode

*Measures of variablity 
 -Variance
 -Standar deviation (code for standard deviatio)
 -orderd statistics (Quantile, percentile, Quartiles, Range, Interquartile Range)

*Realation between numerical variables and covariance
 -To access trend, we have to extrcat relationship between two numerical 
  value.
 -In simple way problem with covariance is we can't say that how is realtion(strong/weak) between the numbers but with the help of corelation term 
  we can derive the strent of relation between two numbers.
 -Refer the COVARIANCE & CORELATION numericals from lecture notes.
